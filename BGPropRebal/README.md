This mod makes the stock turboshaft engines consume less fuel.
In the base game, the small turboshaft engine - which is intended
to be used as the engine for low-tech airplanes - consumes 6.25 
times more fuel than the Juno, the smallest jet engine, which is 
far more powerful. This is simply ridiculous, so it has been 
buffed to consume only 50% or 0.50 times as much fuel as the 
Juno, as it is both an obvious fact and widely stated that
turboprops (which are propeller engines that consume Jet Fuel,
and since in KSP these engines consume the same fuel as the
jet engines, and turboshafts are identical to turboprops, they 
can safely be assumed to be turboprops) consume far less fuel 
than jet engines, and are in fact *the* most efficient gas 
turbine engines. The larger engine, which is intended for 
helicopters, consumed exactly 4 times the fuel as the small 
turboprop in vanilla KSP, and I have changed it accordingly as 
well. You're welcome. Now go build some whacky kerbalprops.
